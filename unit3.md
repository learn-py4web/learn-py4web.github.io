# Unit 3: CSS, SASS, and Bulma Customization

In this unit, we learn about CSS, and we learn how to generate CSS via SASS, which enables the use of scoping and variables, which are missing in CSS.  
We also learn how to use SASS to customize Bulma to our taste. 

## Reading

* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).  In particular, read the selectors portion.  
* [CSS at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSSpra) This is an _excellent_ tutorial, well worth following. 

## Documentation

* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com), a language that enables you to write CSS while preserving your mental sanity. 
* [Bulma Customization](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-sass-cli/).
