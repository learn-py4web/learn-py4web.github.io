# Unit 4: DNS and HTTP.

In this unit, we describe the basics of DNS, and the HTTP protocol. 

## Resources

* [DNS, described in CloudFlare blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/).  This is an excellent description of DNS, both in its normal version and its new encrypted one, and it is highly recommended reading. 
* **[The HTTP protocol,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)** used to transfer HTML pages. **Required reading.**
* [HTTP error codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).  The most important for us are:
    * 200 OK
    * 404 Page Not Found 
    * 500 Server Error -- this means, you have to debug the error!
    * 303 See Other -- this is a redirect that will be instrumental in processing forms. 
    * 304 Not Modified -- this means, the content was found in the cache. 
    * 403 Forbidden -- this typically means an auth type error.
