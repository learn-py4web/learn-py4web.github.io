# Unit 12: Database design

In this unit, you learn how to design the database layout.  We discuss how (and why) to organize the database in multiple tables.  As a running example, we design a database to keep track of classes, offerings of classes in quarters, and student registration to particular class offerings. 
We show you how to query information across multiple tables.
We then show you how to insert information in multiple tables by developing a sample site where students can register to classes.
