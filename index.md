# Learn Py4Web

[py4web](https://py4web.com) is an open-source, Python-based web framework.  This site contains the material for a class that covers py4web in 10 weeks.  The class is taught at the [UCSC School of Engineering](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu) by [Luca de Alfaro](https://luca.dealfaro.com).  Feel free to use the material provided here, and feel free to suggest new material (new videos, tutorials, and so forth).  In fact, feel free to re-make improved versions of the videos, and I will be happy to include them. 

In particular, the class is based on the following frameworks: 

* [py4web](https://py4web.com) as the server-side framework;
* [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as the client-side javascript framework;
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as the css framework.

For more details, you can read the [class syllabus](syllabus.md).
