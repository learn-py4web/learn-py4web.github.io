# Unit 17: Star ratings, file uploads in Vue.js

In this unit, we provide examples of implementation of common interactions in Vue.js, including star rating, and file upload. 

For file upload, we will learn how to upload a file to the server, how to upload (and download) files from Google Cloud Storage (and Amazon S3 is similar), and how to display image previews of files to upload.
