In this unit, we provide examples of implementation of common interactions in Vue.js, including star rating and search bars.

## Code

* [Code for star rating](https://github.com/learn-py4web/star_ratings). Remember, you need to visit the `setup` controller to initialize the database once, before you can use the code.
* [Code to create a search bar](https://github.com/learn-py4web/search_bar).
