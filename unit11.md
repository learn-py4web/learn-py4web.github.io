# Unit 11: Starting a project

This unit gives you advice on how to start a new project.  The gist is: 

* First, think at what pages you need. 
* Then, lay out the database organization. 
* Lastly, code the new pages. 

The first two tasks need to be done all together.  The page development can then be easily split up across a project team.
