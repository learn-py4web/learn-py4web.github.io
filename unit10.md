# Unit 10: Form validation, and grid

In this unit, we discuss input validation in forms, and we present the py4web grid. 

Input validation aims at ensuring that correct information is inserted in the database: for instance, numbers are actually numbers and belong to a proper range, required fields are not left empty, and appropriate constraints hold between field values (in our example, the gross weight is greater than the net weight). 

The py4web grid is a way to quickly construct tables from database content. We show you how to use it and customize it to your needs. 

## Resources

* [Database validators](http://www.web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/07/forms-and-validators#Validators): The documentation is part of the web2py book, but the validators are part of [pydal](https://pypi.org/project/pydal/), the database abstraction layer, and so the documentation applies also to py4web. 
* [Pydal documentation for web2py](http://www.web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/06/the-database-abstraction-layer).  This applies also to py4web. 
* [Pydal documentation for py4web](https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-07.html).  This is essentially the same as the above. 
* [Documentation for py4web forms](https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-12.html). 
* [Documentation for py4web grid](https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-14.html).
