# Unit 9: Generating URLs, HTML, and security considerations

In this unit, we learn how to design URLs to be secure, and to convey information to the server.  
We also learn how to use YATL helpers to generate HTML server-side, and we learn about the role played by YATL in avoiding script injection attacks by safe-quoting the content that is displayed on web pages.
