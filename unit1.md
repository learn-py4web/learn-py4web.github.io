# Unit 1: Installing py4web, and editing code

In this unit, we learn how to install py4web, and how to edit its files via either Visual Studio Code or PyCharm, two sophisticated Python editors.

If you really want, you can also [install py4web via pip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y8ZS__6LiFTeTCSoqRkPSOQLZSxf9y9d/view?usp=sharing), but the recommended way for this class is to install it from source.

_Note: The installation video briefly mentions two minor bugs; these have been fixed already in py4web._
