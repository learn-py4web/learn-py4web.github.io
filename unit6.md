# Unit 6: The Structure of a Scalable Web Server

The basic structure of a web framework like py4web can only be understood if we consider the task of serving dynamic web pages at scale. If we were to design a web server to serve pages to ourselves, while developing on our own laptop, a very different web framework would suffice! 

Here, we consider what is required to serve dynamic web pages at scale, and how those requirements translate in the architecture of a py4web server in the cloud.
